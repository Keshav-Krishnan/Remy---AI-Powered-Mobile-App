## ⚠️ Important Notes

### API Key Security
- ✅ Keys are loaded at runtime (not compile time)
- ✅ Keys are NOT visible in app binary with simple tools
- ⚠️ Advanced reverse engineering could extract keys
- ✅ Acceptable for MVP and TestFlight
- 💡 For production at scale, consider backend proxy

### Rate Limits
- **OpenAI:** Free tier limits apply (~$5/month free credits)
- **Supabase:** Free tier: 500MB database, 2GB bandwidth/month
- 💡 Monitor usage in dashboards during testing

### First Build May Take Longer
- Swift Package Manager needs to download dependencies
- First archive: 5-10 minutes
- Subsequent builds: 1-3 minutes

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "OpenAI API key not configured" error
**Cause:** Config.xcconfig not found or malformed

**Fix:**
1. Verify `Remy/Config/Config.xcconfig` exists
2. Ensure no quotes around values
3. Clean build folder (⇧⌘K)
4. Rebuild project

### "Supabase URL not configured" error
**Cause:** Config.xcconfig missing Supabase config

**Fix:**
1. Open `Remy/Config/Config.xcconfig`
2. Verify `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` are set
3. Rebuild project

### Archive fails with "Code signing error"

**Fix:**
1. Xcode → Preferences → Accounts
2. Add your Apple ID
3. Manage Certificates → Create iOS Distribution certificate
